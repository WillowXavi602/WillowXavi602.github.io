        <h2 id="bio"> About Me <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i> </h2>

        <p class="bio">
            I am Hudson Edward Ford, GIMM student in the 9th Cohort of the program here at Boise State University. I am here to study in game development
            and art to better my skills in development as a whole. The purpose of this website is to document and showcase my work within the GIMM program 
            as a representation of the skills and work I have done here. This also is for showcasing to future careers in hopes of getting a job from this
            program. I hope you enjoy what you see and it helps you also move forward in the program. As for me, I am a 23 year old student who is using This
            program to learn the basics of coding and a bit of art to hopefully help me head into the work environment with a bit more knowledge on how it
            all works. I mostly use my spare time to play games and occasionally work on my own art projects and commisions for others. i love getting to know
            people and hopefully please them and make them happy with me and my work. I hope to make a living with this work and head into new heights
            with my development and art skills in my future workspaces. I hope you enjoy what you see here and have a great day! 
        </p>
