            I am Hudson Edward Ford, GIMM student in the 9th Cohort of the program here at Boise State University. I am here to study in game development
            and art to better my skills in development as a whole. The purpose of this website is to document and showcase my work within the GIMM program 
            as a representation of the skills and work I have done here. This also is for showcasing to future careers in hopes of getting a job from this
            program. I hope you enjoy what you see and it helps you also move forward in the program.
